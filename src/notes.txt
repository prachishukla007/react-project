                           *** Virtual DOM ***

Que: What is a DOM?

Ans: Document Object Model. When our website is rendered, it is rendered because
 of our index.html.
  Our inde.html file looks like 

  <html>
  <header>Header</header>
  <body>There can have  div, h1 etc etc. Inside div we can have p, img, a, href 
  etc tags</body>

  </html>

Now our JS doesn't understand the raw html code. So our BROWSER do one thing,
 it creates a DOM tree, of this HTML (With the Data structure of TREE)

                            HTML
                             |
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 |                                                          |
Head                                                       Body
                                                            |
                                                -------------------------
                                                |           |           |
                                               div         h1          div
                                                |
                                        ------------------
                                        |       |        |
                                        p      img       a



These are all nodes connected on this DOM tree. Now for example in my p tag 
there was a h1 tag in which it is written "hi" and i need to change it to "hello".
Now in JS i have to give every node an id for eg 'p'
and use it as document.getElementById('p') or by classname or by name, then I 
can change the inner text from "hi" to "hello".

Now, if i have to change just this small text i need to re-render the whole 
website, which is not a good practice specially for a big e-com apps.
It causes performance issues.

So, to overcome this issue VIRTUAL DOM has been encounted as the saviour.
Now by using this I just have tp re-render that particular node which needs 
to be changed and not the whole website.

React will create a Virtual DOM (Copy of the main DOM), and when the state 
updates it creates another DOM tree and compare the Virtual DOM with that 
tree, and re-renders only that node which seem chnaged, and DO NOT RE-PAINT 
OR RE-RENDER THE ENTIRE TREE.

This process is called RECONCILLIATION -> by using DIFFING ALGORITHM

Que : What is DIFFING Algo?
Ans : Algo which is to find the difference between both the Trees. Created by
     React Devs which checks where exactly the difference. Can have multiple locs
     of changes.
